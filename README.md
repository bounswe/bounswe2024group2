## Project Status

Also the project plan, user scenarios and mockups can be accessed from the [wiki page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group2/wiki).

## How to render and create diagrams 

For Use case diagram written in PlantUml, you can refer to below information to render and edit our puml file. I will also add a pdf version of the current file.

To change the use case diagram, you can use a docker image for plantuml server and further add/change features in your localhost.

To achieve this, run the commands in your terminal : 

  > docker pull plantuml/plantuml-server:tomcat  (you can use jetty as well as provider)

  > docker run -d -p 8080:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:tomcat (run the image, change the first 8080 whatever port you want to use in local)

then open in your browser : http://localhost:8080 (or the port you choose)

You will see the PlantUml server and you can start editing the puml file of ours.

### Pre-requisites
Make sure you have docker installed in your local machine. If not, you can download it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). To check if you have docker installed, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker --version
```

If you have docker installed, you should see the version of docker you have. If you don't see the version, you should install docker.


### Installation

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2024group2.git

```

3. Build the docker images

```bash

```

4. Run the docker containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

With these commands, you will start the containers for backend, frontend and database. You can access the frontend from `http://localhost:3000` and the backend from `http://localhost:8020`. Database will be running on `localhost:3037`.
